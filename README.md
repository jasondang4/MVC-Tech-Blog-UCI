Exploring tech through words is just as vital as crafting it. While developers dedicate ample hours to crafting new applications and refining existing code, they also invest time in delving into technical concepts, staying abreast of recent advancements, and exploring novel technologies through reading and writing. A mere Google search on any topic covered in this course yields a plethora of insightful articles and tutorials authored by developers of various proficiencies!This week's assignment entails constructing a CMS-style blog platform akin to Wordpress, providing developers with a space to share their insights and engage with fellow developers' posts. From the ground up, you'll develop and deploy this site on Render. Adhering to the MVC paradigm, your application will utilize Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM, and employ the express-session npm package for authentication.
